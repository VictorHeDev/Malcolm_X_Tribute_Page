   <p1>Here's a time line of Malcolm X's life:</p1> 
   <div class="unsorted-list">
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Early life to Adolescence</strong> - Malcolm X was born on May 19th, 1925 as Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska. He was the fourth of Earl and Louise Little’s seven children. His father, Earl, was a Baptist minister and a follower of Marcus Garvey’s black nationalism movement. In 1928, the Littles moved to Lansing, Michigan. They settled in a predominantly white neighborhood, but were sued for eviction. Later that year, their home burned to the ground and no fire wagon was dispatched to the scene. Malcolm loses his father at the age of six. Earl was killed in an incident with the police. Malcolm suspected foul play and later said that the Ku Klux Klan was behind it. After Earl’s death, the Littles applied for public assistance to make ends meet. At age 13, Malcolm’s mother was sent to a mental asylum and his siblings were split throughout various foster families by the state. Malcolm is sent to a juvenile home in a nearly all-white community of Mason, Michigan. He does very well in school there. He earned straight A’s and was elected as the president of his eighth-grade class. However, his teacher discourages him from pursuing his goal of being a lawyer.  
</li>
       <li><strong>Adolescence to Adulthood</strong> - Ella Collins, Malcolm’s half-sister, gained custody of 16-year-old Malcom and moved him to Boston. Over the course of the next few years, he worked odd jobs for places such as railroads, restaurants and bars, shoeshine stands, and a jewelry store. Malcolm completely changes his personality and dress to disguise himself as a modern socialite. He began to dye his hair and wear it straight. He adopted the moniker “New York Red” and he began hustling illegal lottery numbers and dealing paraphernalia. Malcolm received a draft notice. He was found to be “mentally unfit” for military service. In 1944, Malcom was sentenced to four months in jail and one year probation for larceny. After his release, Malcolm moves back to Boston and goes on a stealing spree with his friend Jarvis, and three white women. They attempted to rob a pawn shop which resulted in them being arrested and charged with grand larceny, breaking and entering, and firearms possession. He was convicted and received an eight-to-ten year sentence.</li>
       <li><strong>Malcolm Little to Malcolm X</strong> -  While in prison, Malcolm is introduced to the religion of Islam by one of his siblings. Malcolm began to correspond with the Nation of Islam’s leader, Elijah Muhammad, who was in prison at the time for sedition and violation of draft laws. The two men correspond, and Malcolm continued to study while in prison. He later writes to the governor of Massachusetts demanding the right to practice Islam while incarcerated. He also joined the prison debate team. In 1952, Malcolm was released on parole. He spent one night with his sister, Ella Collins, and then moved to Detroit to live with his brother Wilfred. He joined the Nation of Islam and attended meetings at Detroit’s Temple No. 1, one of the only four temples that the Nation operated at the time. Malcolm rejects his surname “Little” as a slave name given to his family and adopts the surname “X.” He begins to recruit followers under the guidance and blessing of Elijah Muhammad. Membership of the Nation triples in size and Malcolm is promoted to assistant minister in Detroit and then first minister of Temple No. 11 in Boston. Malcolm continued to organize temples along the East Coast and recruited wherever he went.  Elijah Muhammad recognizes Malcolm’s efforts and appoints him to chief minister of Harlem’s Temple No. 7.  In 1957, a New York Temple member Johnson HIlton is savagely beaten by police. Malcolm was alerted by other followers and he joins a contingent of Muslims at the 28th Precinct headquarters in Harlem. He demands Hinton to receive medical attention. Hinton is eventually taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital. The Muslims refuse to disperse, which alarmed the police, until Malcolm made them with a wave of his hand. He later sues New York City for police brutality and wins the largest settlement in its history. Media coverage of Hinton’s incident brought Malcolm to national attention. Police harassment of Malcolm and his family escalates. The FBI continues their surveillance of Malcolm. In 1958, Malcolm and Betty Sanders (later “Betty X”) get married and have their first child, Attalah. 
</li>
       <li><strong>The Nation of Islam</strong> - Malcolm establishes a newspaper Muhammah Speaks to promote the Nation of Islam’s message. The Nation became increasingly involved in business ventures such as opening restaurants and grocery stores. Black writer Alex Haley composes an article about the Nation of Islamd entitled “Mr. Muhammad Speaks” for Reader’s Digest and he begins to work alongside Malcolm. Elijah Muhammad’s health deteriorates and he is moved from Chicago to to Phoenix for health reasons. In 1961, he makes Malcolm the national representative of the Nation of Islam. This creates resentment among the Nation’s inner circle. Malcolm is elevated to a national public figure. He is asked to lecture at college campuses and participate in television and radio debates.  In 1962, an altercation in the Los Angeles Temple between the police and the Nation resulted in the death of an unarmed secretary, Ronald Stokes. Malcolm travels to Los Angeles to eulogize Stokes at a funeral attended by 2,000 people. He urges action and an aggressive response, but Elijah Muhammad pushed back. The jury deliberates Stokes’ killing for 23 minutes and deliberates that it was a “justifiable homicide.” 14 Nation of Islam members are indicted for assult and 11 are found guilty. Later that year, Malcolm confirmed that Elijah Muhammad engaged in acts of adultery and fathered several children with his secretaries. </li>
       <li><strong>The Fallout</strong> - Malcolm works on his autobiography with Alex Haley. Malcolm and Elijah Muhammad’s relationship continues to divide even after Malcolm writes a letter of apology. In December, Malcolm responds to President Kennedy’s assassination with the quote of the homicide as “a case of chickens coming home to roost.” Three days afterwards, Elijah Muhammad ordered Malcolm to be silenced for 90 days. He is forbidden to teach or talk to the press. In 1964, Elijah Muhammad removes Malcolm as the Nation’s national representative and the minister of the Harlem Temple No. 7. In January, Malcolm’s family spends time with boxer Cassius Clay (later Muhammad Ali) as he prepares for his fight against Sonny Liston. Malcolm is suspended by the Nation of Islam indefinitely and he announces his plans to form his own organization called “Muslim Mosque Incorporated.” While a Senate filibuster against the Civil Rights Bill proceeds in Washington, Malcolm meets with Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. In April, Malcolm delivers his “Ballot or the Bullet” speech and then leaves for a five week tour where he makes the pilgrimage to Mecca. </li>
       <li><strong>Mecca and True Islam</strong> - Malcolm receives a new name: El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. During his journey, Malcolm’s attitudes about race change and he finds new appreciation for Islam. He witnessed “pilgrims of all colors from all parts of this earth displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood like I’ve never seen before.” His new ideals included peace for all. Upon his return to America, the feud between Malcolm and his once mentor Elijah Muhammad escalated. Malcolm meets with two of Nation of Islam secretaries who are filing paternity suits against Muhammad. The Nation attempted to seize Malcolm’s home in Queens, NY and evict him from the property. Malcolm formed the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU) reflecting his political agenda. His prior views of segregation and immigration have transformed to those of cooperation and integration with an underlying belief that the religion of Islam can erase racial lines. He identified racism, and not the white race, as the enemy of justice. As a result of spearheading OAAU, Malcolm increases efforts with working in the UN and visits African leaders. Malcolm’s home in East Elmhurst was firebombed “upon the orders of Elijah Muhammad.” </li>
       <li><strong>Death</strong> - Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21st, 1965 while speaking at an OAAU rally in the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem, NY. Three members of the Nation of Islam are later convicted. Over 20,000 people attended his funeral. Later that year, the Autobiography of Malcolm X as told by Alex Haley was published, and Betty Sanders/X/Shabazz gave birth to Malcolm’s last two daughters. </li>
       <li><strong>Legacy</strong>: Malcolm X was known as one of the most influential African Americans in history. He was a Muslim minister and a human rights activist. His detractors accused him of preaching racism and violence. In his early days as a public figure, he advocated African-Americans to protect themselves against aggression “by any means necessary,” which was a stance that contrasted Civil Rights leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s nonviolent approach. After reaffirming his faith during his journey to Mecca, he changed his perspective and worked tirelessly to spread ideals of peace and cooperation. My purpose for this page is to show that Malcolm was a complex, multi-dimensionan human being. He was, in-part, a product of his environment and the America he grew up in. However, he chose to take a stance many different times to further his beliefs and he became a voice for those who were afraid to speak. He was betrayed by a mentor and former friends. Despite falling down so many times, he continued to stand up for his convictions. 2020 was an incredibly turbulent year as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. There is so much misinformation and some indviduals refuse to accept the reality that is not portrayed by their favorite media source. I think it is important to keep an open mind about problems in the world and to remember those who fought bravely in the past to improve our future.
